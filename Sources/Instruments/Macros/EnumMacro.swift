/// Defines a struct with a given raw value that is intended to be used as an enum with unknown
/// number of cases. Generates conformances to Codable, Equatable, and RawRepresentable protocols.
/// Requieres `RawValue` to conform to `Equatable` and `Codable`.
///
/// This enum is intended to be used when you don't know what cases you may receive from server and
/// you don't want your parser to return error, or if you need to know only about some specific
/// cases.
///
/// Let's say you have following API error structure:
/// ```json
/// {
///    "domain_code": Int
/// }
/// ```
/// so you can declare enum:
/// ```swift
/// @Enum<Int>
/// struct ErrorDomainCode {
///    static let someSpecificCodeYouNeed = ErrorDomainCode(-42)
///    static let anotherSpecificCodeYouNeed = ErrorDomainCode(-43)
/// }
/// ```
/// and error structure:
/// ```swift
/// struct MyAPIError: Error, Codable {
///    let domainCode: ErrorDomainCode
/// }
/// ```
/// and later somewhere in code:
/// ```swift
/// if error.domainCode == .someSpecificCodeYouNeed {
///    react(to: error)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Now in cases when backend developers add new domain codes your parser won't return with error
/// and you can process error without magic numbers.
